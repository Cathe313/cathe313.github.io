            <p class="about">I've had lots of fun and worn many hats in my previous career as a 
            Communications Specialist (thank you CERIC - that was awesome!): translator, social 
            media manager, content curator, magazine editor, website administrator - none of which 
            I had training for, all of which I learnt quickly, all of which I did efficiently. I 
            don't think there is much you can't do when you really put your mind to it. Besides, 
            a job where you don't constantly learn is a dead-end, not a career.<br/>
            I recently made a career change that took me from communications to 
            web development - a change that's not as radical as it sounds, since the obsession with 
            detail and ease with languages that I inherited from my previous career have been 
            greatly helpful in mastering the skills needed for web development. The course I took 
            with DecodeMTL (see Projects page for details) covered full-stack web development, and I am 
            now looking for an opportunity to put my new skills to work and keep learning, in my 
            wonderful, new hometown of Sherbrooke, QC.</p>
            <!--<p class="about">Some things you won't learn about me if you only read my resume:</p>-->
            <!--<ul>-->
            <!--    <li>I draw a lot of energy from working with other people. I tried working from -->
            <!--    home a few times but never could cope with the loneliness.</li>-->
            <!--    <li>I thrive on change, something I used to deal with by moving city/country every-->
            <!--    year, but which I now deal with by constantly learning and meeting new people-->
            <!--    (one has to settle down eventually!). This partially explains my career move towards-->
            <!--    web development, a field that's constantly changing.</li>-->
            <!--    <li>I come from Montreal's North Shore but have lived in English for-->
            <!--    so long that I basically have two first languages now.</li>-->
            <!--    <li>Personal motto: Remorse is better than regret.</li>-->
            <!--    <li>My biggest life goal is to learn Mandarin chinese.</li>-->
            <!--</ul>-->
